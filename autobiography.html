    <h1>My Autobiography</h1>
    
    <p>My name is <strong>Hazel Lyka Deligencia Quidet</strong>, and I was born and raised in Kasiglahan Village, Montalban, Rodriguez, Rizal. On October 13,2005. I grew up in a simple but complete family with three sisters, and I am the third child. My family taught me the value of hard work, perseverance, and the importance of staying happy in life, especially my father who has always been my greatest inspiration.</p>

    <p>When I was two years old, my aunt (my father’s sister) wanted to adopt me and bring me to the United States, since she struggled with fertility.My father did not approve because, as he said, he saw himself in me-we share the same attitude and even look alike. That moment made me realize how much my family valued me, and I am grateful to have grown up surrounded by their love and support.</p>

    <p>I am currently studying <strong>Bachelor of Arts in English Language Studies</strong> at San Mateo Municipal College. Previously, I enrolled in Bachelor of Education Major in English, but I decided to shift for personal reasons and to explore more opportunities. Along the way, I discovered my passion for learning and my determination to improve myself.</p>

    <p>My dream is to become a successful person someday. While I am still exploring what specific profession I will pursue, I know that I want to dedicate myself to continuous growth and make a positive impact in my community.</p>
