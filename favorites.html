    <h2>1. Favorite Food</h2>
    <p>Anything that my mom cooks. Ice cream because it gives me comfort when I'm sad. 
    When it comes to fruits, I want mango, pineapple, rambutan, banana, and apple.</p>

    <h2>2. Favorite Hobbies</h2>
    <p>Everyday I enjoy scrolling on social media and reading the latest chismis or news about what's happening in the Philippines. 
    I also like reading articles about interesting facts, news, artist lifestyles, and many more. 
    In my free time, I enjoy cooking. I learned to cook when I was young. 
    I love to sleep, listen to music, and watch movies—my favorite genres are romance and comedy. 
    Sometimes I love playing games like Roblox and other simulator games. 
    I enjoy solving jigsaw puzzles and word search games as my stress relievers. 
    I always love to talk with my family and friends, whether in person or through calls. 
    I’m the type of person who is a good listener and I also love journaling.</p>

    <h2>3. Favorite Music / Artists</h2>
    <p>My favorite music genres are pop, K-pop, and OPM.

    <p>One of my favorite songs is <strong>"Bata, Dahan-Dahan"</strong> by IV of Spades because it talks about the kids nowadays. 
    IV of Spades is one of my all-time favorite OPM bands. Some of their songs are deep and meaningful. 
    This band helped me during the COVID pandemic; their songs healed me. 
    I also love Gloc-9 and Abra because their songs talk about society and contain life lessons. 
    I really like songs with deep meanings because they inspire me.</p>

      <li>Jolina Magdangal and Marvin Agustin movies like <em>Labs Kita, Okay Lang?</em></li>
    </ul>
    <p>These movies inspire me and also help me relax.</p>

    <h2>5. Favorite Places</h2>
    <p>One of my favorite places to visit is the mall because it makes me feel calm and refreshed.
